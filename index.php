Instead, our team has a ton of experience building solutions and products on the Force.com platform (among others) and includes previous Salesforce.com employees and instructors. We counter technical expertise with creative thinking and a need to push boundaries and ourselves. We're committed to doing the job right and having a blast while doing it. Sound like you?
