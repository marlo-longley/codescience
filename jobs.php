			<h4>CodeScience, Inc. is a provider of technology and professional services that enable organizations to deploy strategic business processes into the cloud. Our primary focus is building on the Force.com platform. Using equal parts precision and play, we create products for Salesforce ISV Partners and tackle complex Salesforce implementations. We also work with other cloud platforms such as Heroku and Box.</h4>

<h4>The team mostly works from home or at our headquarters office in Chattanooga. Our homies, the lucky ones getting the home office allowance, are clustered around the San Francisco Bay area with a few rogue consultants in Atlanta, Denver and Los Angeles.</h4>

<h4>Benefits are solid, travel is limited, and we don't track vacation time. More important, we work on some of the most challenging projects in our little niche of the software industry. We're excited to tackle the projects that others shy from.</h4>
